# Task List

This is Task list back-end service to demonstrate how authentication works with SPA applications as part of my book [Understanding React](https://leanpub.com/understandingreact). This book is completely free for my students (if you want to read it, just write to me).

# Install and Start

- Install maven
- git clone https://github.com/enriquemolinari/tasklist.git tasklist
